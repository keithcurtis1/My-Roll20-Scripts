This script was pulled from the forums, but I have modified it to work with Combat Master by Victor B (available on One Click install)

It just watches for a hit point reduction on any token with the concetration token. It then gives you a Constitution Saving Throw Link to click. If the caster fails, you can click the Toggle Concetration button to bring up the CM status window.
